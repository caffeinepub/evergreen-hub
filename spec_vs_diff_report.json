  "summary": "The diff implements all four requirements. REQ-1 (Footer), REQ-2 (InstagramSection), REQ-3 (YouTubeSection), and REQ-4 (FacebookSection) are all updated with the correct real URLs, target='_blank', and rel='noopener noreferrer'. However, REQ-4 also specifically mentions Header.tsx, MobileSidebar.tsx, and AboutUs.tsx as files to scan and update, and none of these appear in the diff as modified files.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-4",
      "requirement": "Scan all remaining frontend components including Header.tsx, MobileSidebar.tsx, and AboutUs.tsx and update any placeholder or empty social media links with real URLs.",
      "reason": "The diff only modifies FacebookSection.tsx for REQ-4. Header.tsx, MobileSidebar.tsx, and AboutUs.tsx are not present in the modified files list, yet they were explicitly called out in REQ-4 as files to scan and update if they contain social media links.",
