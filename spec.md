# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Replace all placeholder/empty social media links across the Evergreen Hub frontend with real, functional URLs that open in a new tab.

**Planned changes:**
- Update Footer social media links (YouTube, Facebook, Instagram) with real URLs and `target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"`
- Update InstagramSection follow/view-profile links to use the real Instagram URL
- Update YouTubeSection subscribe button and channel links to use the real YouTube URL
- Scan and update all remaining components (FacebookSection, Header, MobileSidebar, AboutUs, etc.) to replace any placeholder or `#` social media links with the correct real URLs

**User-visible outcome:** Clicking any YouTube, Facebook, or Instagram link/button anywhere on the site opens the correct real social media profile or channel in a new browser tab.
