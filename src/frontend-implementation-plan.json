Locate the button that opens the CoursePackagesModal (likely labeled 'Buy Course' or similar) and remove it from the JSX, keeping only the 'Explore Courses' button that handles smooth scrolling to the courses section. Ensure the remaining button retains its current styling, positioning, and onClick handler for scroll functionality. Do not modify the hero section background image reference (frontend/public/assets/generated/hero-bg.dim_1920x1080.png), headline, subheadline, or container layout. Remove any state management or handlers related to the removed button (e.g., modal open state) if they are no longer used elsewhere in the component."
