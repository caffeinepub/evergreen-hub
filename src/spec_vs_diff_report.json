REQ-52 (PaymentGateway component) displays all bank details correctly with proper instructions. REQ-53 (payment proof submission form) includes transaction ID and screenshot upload with validation. REQ-54 (Buy Now buttons opening payment modal) is implemented with PaymentModal integration. REQ-55 (backend payment proof storage) is implemented with PaymentProof type, blob storage, and status management. However, the diff is truncated for several files, limiting full verification of all acceptance criteria details.",
